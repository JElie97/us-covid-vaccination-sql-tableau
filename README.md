# U.S. COVID-19 Vaccination Trends (SQL + Tableau Public Project)
- This project explores U.S. COVID-19 vaccination trends using SQL for data and Tableau Public
# Tools Used
- MySQL
- Tableau Public
- Microsoft Excel (Web Version for initial viewing)
- Kaggle (data source)
  # Project Objectives
  - Clean and Prepare raw COVID-19 vaccination data using MySQL
  - Analyze the 7-day trends and vaccinations rates by age group
  - Visualize insights with Tableau dashboards
    # Step 1: Data Cleaning in MySQL
    - Key Cleaning Steps:
    - Remove Duplicates
    - Checked for and handled nulls
    - Added a primary key column
    - Exported the cleaned dataset as a '.csv'
    # See the full cleaning steps here -->
    # Step 2: Visualization in Tableau Public
    - I designed multiple visualizations:
    - Line chart for 7-Day Average Case Trend Over Time
    - Line chart for Vaccination Progress Over Time
    - Bar chart for Vaccination Completed by Age Group

        ## Key Takeaways from the project
        - Stronger understanding of data cleaning with sql
        - Gained experience in publishing visual dashboards to Tableau Public
        - Learned how to prep data across tools for analysis storytelling
          # Next Steps
          - I plan to explore more datasets with SQL and Tableau Public and add more projects to my portfolio.
          - In addition, I want to incorporate excel along with SQL and Tableau into future projects and add it to my portfolio.
